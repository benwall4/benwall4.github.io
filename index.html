        My name is Benjamin Wall and I am an environmental studies major that wants to make a difference in the world! I love backpacking, snowboarding, and all things outdoors and believe that protecting the natural environment and the wildlife that resides in it is one of the largest problems our generation currently faces. Feel free to explore the website and thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me!
